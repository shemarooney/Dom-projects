1. Write a JavaScript program to remove items from a drop-down (select) list.

2. Write a JavaScript program to calculate sphere volume. Make sure to use HTML input 
fields to capture the values

3. Using this page designed in the previous exercise (https://prnt.sc/iFgG4NkhQfx9)
Add form validation to the fields:
- Username: Should accept only lowercases, numbers, and _ or . only. Length should be 5-10 characters
- Password: Should contain atleast 1 uppercase , 1 lowercase and 1 special character length should be 8-16 characters.

The validation should work:
- When the user tries to click the login button, when all the conditions aren't met yet
- When a field is blurred, or is focused and loses the focus again when the field validation isn't fixed yet
- When there's a validation error, there should be a message under the field indicating what to be 
fixed/ what caused the error. EX: https://prnt.sc/vK0N8owk9PAS
- When a user clicks the submit button after all validation conditions are met, navigate the user to this 
page (https://prnt.sc/-RKoeQyfAG7u)
